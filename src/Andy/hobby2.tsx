                I'm Andy, and I'm a student at WPI. I'm currently doing my bachelors'degree in Computer Science.
                My biggest dream is to become a better version of myself every day.

                My favorite hobbies are play video games, watch movies, go out with my girlfriend, and workout at the
                gym.
